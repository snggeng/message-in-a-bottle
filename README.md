* Finished: April 30th
* Hours: 100 hours
* Consulted with: NONE
* Online Resources: [A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/introduction/)
* Assets: 3D bottles from https://sketchfab.com/models/beb69bc08a8f487ab8c5207fb155cbf2#download by Francesco Coldesina

#### Why did we make this? 
Our application is useful because itâ€™s an platform that connects people all over the world, and allows them to express themselves. Anyone can create a bottle containing their message to the world, and view the messages others have created. Given a degree of Internet anonymity, what will users write? What legacies will they leave behind in their bottles? The possibilities are endless.

#### References for your data that establishes its authenticity 
All of our data are direct user inputs. The database is dynamic.

## Getting Started
#### Clone this project and change directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/snggeng/message-in-a-bottle.git message-in-a-bottle
cd message-in-a-bottle
```
#### Install dependencies:
_**NOTE**: This project uses `Node.js` and ES6 features. You need to have Node installed and it is recommended that your version of Node is `v8.11.1` which is the LTS version._

To check what version of node you are running:
```
node -v
```

If you do not have `Node.js` installed in your local machine, [download it here](https://www.google.com/search?q=download+nodejs&oq=download+nodejs&aqs=chrome..69i57.2421j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

Install npm packages:
```
npm install
```

#### Development
This is the file tree of our project:
```
root
 |- client
 |- react-client
 |- server
```
The `client` folder is a static html implementation of the WebVR environments used in this project. The `react-client` folder is the frontend for this project, and contains a React app which renders the WebVR scenes along with other components that allow the user to manipulate data in our application. The `server` folder is the backend of this project, which is hosted in production using heroku.

###### Server (Backend)
To start the server:
```
cd server && npm start
```

To (manually) test server endpoints, either use [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (equivalent GUI for making http calls):

Sample curl:
```
curl http://localhost:3000/public
// => {"message": "hi"}
```

To deploy:
```
heroku create
```
Make sure that your remote is now set to heroku as well:
```
git remote -v
# you should see 4 remote links, 2 prefixed with origin, 2 prefixed with heroku
# if there aren't 2, run this to set your remote
# heroku git:remote -a app-name
```
Push your changes to Heroku:
```
git push heroku master
```

To get access to the database files, you can export them from mLab with the following commands:
```
mongoexport -h <mlab-host:port> -d heroku_2889j77f -c users -u <heroku-user-id> -p <heroku-project-id> -o /path/to/file.json
mongoexport -h <mlab-host:port> -d heroku_2889j77f -c bottles -u <heroku-user-id> -p <heroku-project-id> -o /path/to/file.json

```
This will export a JSON of each collection `bottles` and `users`, which are the two collections we are using in our database. Remember to set the `/path/to/file` to where you want to save your JSON.

###### React-client (Frontend)
To start the server:
```
cd react-client && yarn install && yarn start
```
To deploy:
```
yarn build
```
